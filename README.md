# UkiExpress
A small java app built by using Eclipse.

How to run the app:
The app takes two arguments, one is the main application and the other one is a text file.
Simply navigate to the folder destination on command prompt, e.g., C:\Users\Yuki\Documents\UkiExpress
Then, run the following command lines:
C:\Users\Yuki\Documents\UkiExpress\java UkiExpress <text file name>

Click any item on the left to add it to the order. The price and item are shown on the right side.
When finished ordering, enter credit card number to process the order.
Click "cancel" button to restart the order.
Click "confirm" button after the credit card number is entered.
If the credit card is not valid, the order would not be process and the whole order has to restart all over.

There are different test cases included within the folder.
1) Menu.txt: Contain the menu, with name and price separated by a bar |.
2) invalidprice.txt: The price in the menu contains invalid characters.
3) noinput.txt: Empty text file.
4) noname.txt: The menu does not contain a name, only price.
5) noprice.txt: One of the item in the menu does not contain price.
